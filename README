A small scheme-like interpreter.

It was written so I could learn some about interpreters and languages in
general.

It is a horrible mess. The parser resides in Tokenizer.java (wtf!) and it's full
of FIXMEs and TODOs. It is NOT suited for any use at all. Please go away!!

I hope to implement a reader and a parser so it will be much prettier.

The interpreter does now support proper tail calls. You have to, however, 'tag'
your tail calls with (tail (call-this ...)). I am sure it's 'easy' to fix, but
I have not yet decided on how.
