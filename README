A small scheme-like interpreter.

It was written so I could learn some about interpreters and languages in
general.

It is a horrible mess. The parser resides in Tokenizer.java (wtf!) and it's full
of FIXMEs and TODOs. It is NOT suited for any use at all. Please go away!!

It does not support proper tail calls as java does not. I have not yet figured
how to get proper tail calls, but using a byte code interpreter could probably
work. That's too much work for now, though.
