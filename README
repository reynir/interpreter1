A small scheme-like interpreter.

It was written so I could learn some about interpreters and languages in
general.

It is a horrible mess. The parser resides in Tokenizer.java (wtf!) and it's full
of FIXMEs and TODOs. It is NOT suited for any use at all. Please go away!!

I hope to implement a reader and a parser so it will be much prettier.

The interpreter supports proper tail calls by trampolining.
